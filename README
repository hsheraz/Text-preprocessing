1) split.py: 
	run: python -m split ‘file.txt’ ‘file.splitted’
		Result: results as expected
2) Tokenize.py:
	run: python -m Tokenize ‘file.splitted’ ‘file.tokenized’
		use the Professor’s code as a base and made my way up
		this file tokenizes values and does post-processing for Hyphen, apostrophe and punctuation, it also has some processing for token count
		Result: The punctuations are a bit off does not pick up things like this i.e (text ) or ’89 otherwise the results are as expected
3) pos-tag.py:
	run: python-m ‘file.tokenized’ ‘file.tagged’
	Results: I believe the results are as expected
